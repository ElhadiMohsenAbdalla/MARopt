### MARopt: a tool for optimization of managed aquifer recharge measures

The MARopt tool is developed in the EviBAN project (https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/eviban/). MARopt tool is created for optimizing the placement of Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) measures at rural catchments, based on coupling a node-based hydrological model with a multi-objective optimization algorithm. MARopt allows the user to create a simple node model that can be calibrated and compared with measurement. Then, the calibrated hydrological model can be used to generate pareto optimal solutions for NBS based on cost and performance, which can be visualised and compared in the tool. 

The MARopt tool is available online in this link: https://eviban.shinyapps.io/maropt/ .
